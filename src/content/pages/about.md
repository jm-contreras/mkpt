I've been an athlete my whole life—four years as a varsity rower at [Notre Dame](https://fightingirish.com/roster/morgan-kelley/), a decade of CrossFit, and 18 years in team sports and group fitness. These days, I'm a [VP at OneMain Financial](https://www.linkedin.com/in/morgan-kelley-a3123243/) by day and a personal trainer and nutrition coach in the hours I've carved out for the work I love most.

My coaching career started at [Orlando Area Rowing Society](https://www.oarsrowing.com/), where I taught learn-to-row classes for middle and high schoolers—up to 25 athletes at a time, most with zero rowing experience and wildly different fitness backgrounds. That's where I learned that good coaching isn't about running everyone through the same drill. It's about watching, adjusting, and finding the cue that clicks for this person, right now.

**How I coach**

I'm strict about one thing: form. Proper technique isn't just about better results—it's about staying healthy long enough to keep showing up. I'll correct your squat, I'll slow you down when you need it, and I'll explain why so you're not just following instructions but actually learning your body.

That said, I keep things fun. I've never believed that intensity and encouragement are opposites. I want you to work hard and leave feeling better than when you started. I do ice-breakers. I celebrate small wins. I believe building community matters as much as building muscle—fitness should support your mental health, not drain it.

**Why virtual?**

I miss the energy of group coaching, but I've found that virtual training lets me offer something group settings can't: real individualized attention. You get programming built for your goals, your equipment, your life—plus direct feedback on your form and consistent accountability without needing to live near a gym I work at.

If you're looking for a coach who'll push you and cheer for you in equal measure, let's talk.
